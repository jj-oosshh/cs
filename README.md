## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [Date]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included watching videos and doing problems
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were the mcq
- Time management techniques that worked well for me go back to questions I couldn't do after doing the other questions
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions relax and read it clearly to try to understand

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: 2D arrays
- Topic/Concept 2: Using loops for arrays
- Programming practice: I hope to understand 2D arrays better
